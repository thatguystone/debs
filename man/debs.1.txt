NAME
----
debs - build debian packages and dput them


SYNOPSIS
--------
*debs* [-h] [-c .debsrc] [-e ENV] [--ignore-versions] [--list-envs]
       [--delete-envs] [--list-remotes] [-n] [--no-versions] [-r REMOTE]
       [-y] [-v]
       [package [package ...]]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Debs was born out of the lack of simple tools for creating, managing, and
deleting sbuild enviornments while providing simple support for building a
bunch of packages. Building packages is painful enough already without having
to remember crazy incantations just to start a build.


OPTIONS
-------
*-c, --config*::

    Extra configuration files to load.

*-e, --env*::

    Which environment to use for the build. If given multiple times, multiple
    environments will be used. Environments are matched based on
    prefix/suffix. For example, if given "stretch-", this will match "stretch-
    amd64" and "stretch-i386". If given "-amd64", all known "amd64"
    environments are matched.

    The value "all" may be given to select all known environments.

    A few aliases exist for convenience: debian-stable, debian-testing,
    debian-unstable, ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-lts. These may be used in any env
    spec, and they will be expanded to the current release (ie. debian-stable
    => jessie).

*--list-envs*::

    List all supported environments. Ones with "*" next to them indiciate that
    they are installed locally.

*--delete-envs*::

    Delete the chroot environments, as selected by *-e/--env*.

*--list-remotes*::

    List all known remotes (from dput).

*-n, --dry-run*::

    Don't build or upload, just do some basic checks, update environments, and
    the like.

*--ignore-versions*::

    Ignore the contents of <<X1,*~/.debs/versions*>> and just build
    everything.

*--no-versions*::

    Don't write a versions file to <<X1,*~/.debs/versions*>>, and ignore it if
    it already exists.

*-r, --remote*::

    Which remote to use. This may be given multiple times to select multiple
    remotes. If none is given, uses the remote named "default".
    ::
    The value "all" may also be given to select all dput hosts.

*-y, --batch*::

    Assume the answer to every question is yes unless questioning about how to
    handle errors.

*-v, --verbose*::

    Print commands as they are executed.


FILES
-----
~/.debs/debsrc::

    User configuration file. This file is superseded by package- and
    directory-specific configuration files.

*/.debsrc::

    Package- and directory-specific configuration. Starting at the current
    directory, the directory tree is climbed, searching for a .debsrc file in
    each parent directory. Parent configuration files are applied in reverse
    order; that is, options in a configuration file of a child supersede those
    of a parent (with some exceptions; see *debsrc*(5) for more details).

[[X1]]
~/.debs/versions::

    Contains user-specific build versions. This is used to limit rebuilds of
    already-built packages when building a directory that contains many
    packages.
